            <h2>What The Atlas Is</h2>
            <p>
                The Abundant City Policy Atlas is a tool to track and display pro-housing, pro-urban policies adopted in jurisdictions throughout the United States. 
                You can use it to track the spread of policy reforms throughout the country, or alternatively to examine which changes a particular 
                jurisdiction has adopted.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can filter reforms by type, jurisdiction (city/county/state), population, location, and view results on an interactive map or as a detailed list.
            </p>

            <h2>Who Created This</h2>
            <p>
                This map was created by urbanist advocates to make parking and zoning reform data more accessible and actionable. The project combines data from the Parking Reform Network and UC Berkeley's Othering & Belonging Institute into a single, searchable interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                The map is built with:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Vanilla JavaScript with Mapbox GL JS for mapping</li>
                <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Netlify Functions (serverless) with PostgreSQL/PostGIS database</li>
                <li><strong>Data:</strong> Regular ingestion from PRN and Berkeley ZRT sources</li>
                <li><strong>Hosting:</strong> Netlify with Neon (serverless PostgreSQL)</li>
            </ul>
